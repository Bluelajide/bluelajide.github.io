MOBILITY FRICTION MAPPING: SEATTLE ACCESSIBILITY ANALYSIS
Datathon Project - Complete Deliverables Summary
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project analyzes 81,973 sidewalk accessibility barriers across Seattle
to reveal geographic inequities and provide data-driven recommendations for
improving urban accessibility infrastructure.

KEY INNOVATION: Mobility Friction Index (MFI)
A novel 0-100 metric quantifying how difficult it is to move through Seattle's
neighborhoods by combining: Barrier Density (30%), Average Severity (25%), 
Permanence Ratio (25%), and Hotspot Clusters (20%).

HEADLINE FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• 20× INEQUITY GAP between highest (Industrial District: 96.5) and lowest 
  (South Lake Union: 4.9) friction neighborhoods
• 99% OF BARRIERS ARE PERMANENT, indicating systemic design failures
• 698 ACCESSIBILITY HOTSPOTS identified requiring intervention
• 68.9% ML ACCURACY in predicting barrier severity
• 2 PRIORITY AREAS need immediate action: Industrial District & Ravenna
