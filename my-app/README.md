# My App (Vite + React)

This is a minimal scaffold created to run the `OnlineEscapeRoom` component.

Getting started (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\quang\OneDrive\Desktop\Projects\my-app"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Tailwind CSS is configured in this scaffold (see `tailwind.config.cjs` and `postcss.config.cjs`). The component uses Tailwind utility classes for styling.
- `lucide-react` is added to `package.json` dependencies.

After cloning/creating the scaffold, install dependencies and run the dev server (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\quang\OneDrive\Desktop\Projects\my-app"
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you don't see the Tailwind utilities applied, ensure the install completed successfully. If you want I can run `npm install` and start the dev server from here — say "Run install and start" and I'll attempt it.
